## ðŸŒŠ Overview  
The **Shark Smell Optimization (SSO)** algorithm mimics sharks' ability to detect and follow odor gradients to locate prey. It optimizes solutions by:  
- **Forward movement**: Guided by the objective function's gradient.  
- **Rotational movement**: Local search to refine solutions.  

Applications include:  
- Hyperparameter tuning in ML models.  
- Speaker recognition tasks.  
- Continuous/constrained optimization problems.
